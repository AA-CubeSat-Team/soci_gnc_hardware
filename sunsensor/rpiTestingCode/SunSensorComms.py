#Sun Sensor General Communication code written by William Lacrampe
#This code is meant to be used to try and get the sun sensor to respond to each command. It does not keep track
#of the data the sun sensor returns; other scripts must be used for that kind of testing. This is just to make sure
#we can use every command with the sun sensor and get something back. The code will repeatedly ask the user which command
#the user wants to try.
